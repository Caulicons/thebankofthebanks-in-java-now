# The Bank of Banks 🏦

A Java-based banking system simulation that demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and clean architecture.

## Project Overview

The Bank of Banks is a console application that simulates basic banking operations including:

- Client management (CRUD operations)
- Account management (Current and Savings accounts)
- Banking operations (deposits, withdrawals, transfers)
- Interest calculations for savings accounts
- Overdraft facility for current accounts

## Technologies Used

- Java 21
- Maven
- JUnit 5
- Mockito
